```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Here's a test! Class practice with Github. Woo!

*testing again*

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

# Plot

***plot*** 

**plot**

*plot*

[plot] <- links it 

image: ![](path/to/smallorb.png) 

> block quote

* unordered list
* item 2
  + sub-item 1
  + sub-item 2 

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



## Example plot 

```{r songs, echo=FALSE}

songs_data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eco-evo-thr-2022/05-simple-metrics/hill/song_plays.csv")

head(songs_data)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(songs_data, aes(rank, plays)) +
  geom_line()

```
